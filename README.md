<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

-->Bridging Communication Gaps: Sign language detection technology helps facilitate interaction between the Deaf and hearing communities.\
-->Role of AI in Accessibility: Deep learning models improve real-time recognition, making sign language interpretation more accurate.\
-->Project Objective: Developing an AI model to recognize and translate sign language using computer vision and deep learning.

<b>PROJECT OBJECTIVES</b>

-->Develop an AI Model: Create a deep learning model capable of recognizing and translating sign language.\
-->Enhance Accessibility: Enable real-time communication between sign language users and non-signers.\
-->Integrate Audio Output: Convert detected signs into corresponding speech for improved interaction.

<b>DATASET PREPARATION</b>

<b>-->Hand Gesture Categories:</b>
  The dataset includes six hand gesture categories: "hello," "thanks," "please," "yes," "no," and "I love you,"etc.. each represented by 25 images to ensure comprehensive coverage.\
<b>-->Image Collection Process:</b>
    Images were captured using Jupyter Notebook, ensuring high-quality visuals and consistency across the dataset for effective model training.\
<b>-->Labeling with Roboflow:</b>
    Roboflow was used to label the images, creating precise bounding boxes around the hand gestures to facilitate accurate model training and evaluation.

<b>MODEL SELECTION & TRAINING</b>
  
 <b> -->Choosing YOLO for Detection YOLO :</b> (You Only Look Once) was selected for its real-time detection capabilities and efficiency.\
  <b>-->Training on Google Colab: </b>The model was trained using Google Colab, leveraging T4 GPU acceleration for faster computations.\
  <b>-->Performance Metrics:</b> Evaluation was done using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1- score to measure effectiveness.

<b>CONCLUSION & FUTURE SCOPE</b>

<b>-->Impact on Accessibility:</b> This project improves communication for the Deaf community by bridging the gap between sign language users and non-signers.\
<b>-->Enhancements for Future:</b> Expanding the dataset and incorporating more signs to improve model robustness and accuracy.\
<b>-->Integration with Smart Devices:</b> Potential for deployment in mobile apps and smart assistants for real-time sign language translation.
